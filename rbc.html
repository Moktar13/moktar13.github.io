							<h1>Royal Bank of Canada</h1>
							<p>
								RBC Mobile Banking application provides a user-friendly and feature-rich platform, offering seamless financial services, investment options, and account management for millions of clients.</p>
						</header>
						<p>I worked directly on RBC's mobile banking application - both during my time as a co-op student and during my time as a fulltime iOS developer.</p>
						<p> During my time at RBC, 
							I revamped the biometrics experience for a substantial user base, facilitated the migration of a large client group to RBC Mobile Banking, 
							and enhanced account functionalities for widespread accessibility. My contributions also played a key role in enabling millions of users to 
							seamlessly invest through the app, resulting in significant financial transactions within the initial launch period. Additionally, I contributed 
							to the development of complex features in four major product releases.</p>
